# Clash-Royale-Real-Time-Deck-Strength-Predictor
This is a predictor of deck strength based on the card data and real time top player winning rate. 
To use this, simply download the files, replace file path, and run it on your computer. 

First, run the 0.import request.py. Then you'll get a .csv file. If the file is not encodable on your computer, run 1. Convert CSV Encoding.py. Then, run the 2. Deck Data Filter.py to filter the decks with sufficient amount of data and correct amount of cards (i.e. the decks in low ladder that has less than 8 cards is eliminated). Finally, run 3. Full Code to get the predictor. Enjoy!
